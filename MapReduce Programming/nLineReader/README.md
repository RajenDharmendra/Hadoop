# Hadoop

Goal:

I want to be able to specify the number of mappers used on an input file
Equivalently, I want to specify the number of line of a file each mapper will take
Simple example:

For an input file of 10 lines (of unequal length; example below), I want there to be 2 mappers -- each mapper will thus process 5 lines.

This is
an arbitrary example file
of 10 lines.
Each line does
not have to be
of
the same
length or contain
the same
number of words
